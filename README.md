# Basic-framework

This is a modern framework built in PHP 8, designed around a modular plugin system. The framework allows for easy scalability and customization through well-structured plugins that handle various functionalities and parts of the application. Each plugin operates as a standalone unit, enabling simple management, activation, or deactivation based on project requirements.

The framework focuses on simplicity, clean code, and ease of use. By leveraging new PHP 8 features such as named arguments, union types, and attributes, it delivers high performance and reliability. Itâ€™s ideal for developers seeking a flexible solution to create complex web applications with minimal effort.
